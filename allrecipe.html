                        <p>Rendang is a wonderfully perfumed, thick, spiced stew from Indonesia and is often touted as one of the tastiest foods in the world. It normally takes hours of stirring and vigilant care, but of course using leftover brisket means it can be made in a reasonably short time, with equally tender, beautiful results.</p>

                        <p>Who doesn’t love a good chicken burger? These are perfect for summer eating, whether you’re firing up the barbecue or cooking indoors. Juicy, marinated chicken is piled into a bun with spiced yoghurt, chargrilled peppers and crisp lettuce, then served with grilled corn on the cob for an extra hit of seasonal veg. Get stuck in!</p>
