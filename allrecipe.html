                        <p>Blistered blueberries amplify the deliciousness in this beautiful warm chicken salad.</p>

                        <p>Packed with manganese for cell protection and bone health, and a good source of fibre and anthocyanins, blueberries are a delicious way to support your overall well-being.</p>

                        <h3 class="card__title">Beef Rendang</h3>
                        <p>Rendang is a wonderfully perfumed, thick, spiced stew from Indonesia and is often touted as one of the tastiest foods in the world. It normally takes hours of stirring and vigilant care, but of course using leftover brisket means it can be made in a reasonably short time, with equally tender, beautiful results.</p>

                        <p>Who doesn’t love a good chicken burger? These are perfect for summer eating, whether you’re firing up the barbecue or cooking indoors. Juicy, marinated chicken is piled into a bun with spiced yoghurt, chargrilled peppers and crisp lettuce, then served with grilled corn on the cob for an extra hit of seasonal veg. Get stuck in!</p>

                        <h3 class="card__title">Pappa Alle Zucchine</h3>
                        <p>This amazing beauty of a soup is based on the Italian classic pappa al pomodoro. It's essentially about cooking them low and slow to bring out their deep flavour and sweetness, then pairing them with some bread to add a bit of body. I've used courgettes here, which are great when they're in season, but it would also work well with fennel, pees leeks or asparagus.</p>

                        <h3 class="card__title">Squash Chickpea Stew</h3>
                        <p>This is a delicious dish with great depth of flavour and also from the use of spices, which is common in many parts of Sicily. The island has been invaded and influenced from a culinary point of view several times, so you'll find some North African spices, dried fruit and even couscous, which are more usually associated with Morocco and Tunisia, being used very comfortably in Sicilian cooking.</p>

                        <h3 class="card__title">Bake Chicken Jalfrezi</h3>
                        <p>This jalfrezi-inspired one-tray wonder is all about big flavours with minimal effort. I’ve made the most of two fantastic flavour shortcuts: a spice-packed jalfrezi curry paste, and an onion marmalade to bring sweetness, stickiness, and sourness. The oven does most of the hard work, leaving you with tender, succulent chicken thighs, vibrant colour, and next-level deliciousness.</p>
